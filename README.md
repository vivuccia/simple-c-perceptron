Subprojects (dotp, first neuron without updating parameters), and drafts of perceptron.c/the main code outlined by the Python tutorial.

Older drafts of the perceptron.c file are all nonfunctional IIRC. gradientspt7.c was when I finally managed to get the original system with one pre-defined input vector working, but I continued working on the same file and renamed it... so it's gone
